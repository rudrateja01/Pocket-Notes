Developed a minimalistic note-taking application using React to help users quickly create, view, and manage their notes efficiently.
Stored notes locally using browser storage or a simple backend (optional) for persistence.
Built the app using React functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management.
Implemented features to add, edit, delete, and view notes in a user-friendly interface.
